# MCQ TEST:
## 1. A ({})
 The output of {} is displayed because you assigned an empty object to the greetign variable, and when you log the variable's value, it shows the content of that variable, which is an empty object. The typo in the 
 variable name (greetign instead of greeting) doesn't affect the output.
 ## 2. C("12")
 The answer is c because here 1 is number and "2" is string. So,  "2"(string) is concatinate with 1(number).
 ## 3. A: ['üçï', 'üç´', 'ü•ë', 'üçî']
 Because info.favoriteFood property does not impact the food array because they are different variables. The food array and the info.favoriteFood property are independent of each other, and changing one does not automatically change the other.
 ## 4. B: Hi there, undefined
 The result is undefined because you're not passing any arguments to the sayHi function, and the name parameter remains undefined within the function.
 ## 5. C: 3
 The  output of  is 3 because there are three truthy elements (1, 2, and 3) and 1 falsy element(0) in the nums array, and the count variable is incremented accordingly for each truthy value not falsy value.
